## multiplying a number by a root
Often when rationalizing the denominator, you may run into something like this: $ \frac{8}{\sqrt{67}} $. When rationalizing this number, we can first check if $ \sqrt{67} $ is a perfect root, if it isn't than the rationalized version is simply $ \frac{8\sqrt{67}}{67} $
