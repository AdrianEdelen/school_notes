### Rationalizing The Denominator
Rationalizing the denominator is a way to simplify a fraction by converting the denominator to a rational number for simplicity. the conversation is mathematically the same either way, but some organizations may want you to rationalize. 

```{note}
Historically rationalizing was used to help speed up solving a problem on pen and paper as it reduces the number of square root lookups one would have needed to do, calculators generally obsoleted the need for this.
```

To rationalize, you need to eliminate the square root in the denominator. This can be achieved by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the denominator:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{7}} \times \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}} \\[2em]
\text{The Numerator becomes: }\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{7} = \sqrt{21} \\
\text{And the Denominator becomes: }\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7} = 7 \\[1em]
\text{so we simplify to: }\frac{\sqrt{21}}{7}

$$

When rationalizing some tips to keep in mind are: \
rationalizing a number with two roots e.g. $ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{67}} $ for the numerator, you just multiply the the radicands: $ 3*67 $ for a result of $ \frac{\sqrt{201}}{67} $


```{admonition} Remember!
:class: tip
Squaring a root is the same as removing the radical
and multiplying 2 roots is the same as the multiply the radicands and then adding the root.
```

### Reciprocal Irrationals


you can simplify $ \frac{1}{\frac{x}{y}} $  by taking the fractions reciprocal



$$

\frac{1}{-\frac{8}{9}} = -\frac{9}{8}
