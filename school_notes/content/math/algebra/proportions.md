# Cross Multiplication and Solving For Proportions

In the case that you have a proportion (two equal fractions) with a single variable, this can be solved by cross multiplying:

lets take the case $ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{x}{2\pi} $
- using cross multiplication we multiply the denominator by the numerator and vice versa $ 5 \cdot 2\pi = 9 \cdot x $
    - which simplifies to: $ x = \frac{5\cdot 2\pi}{9} $
    - which simplifies to: $ x = \frac{10\pi}{9} $
