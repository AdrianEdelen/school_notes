## Dividing By A Fraction

In order to divide by a fraction e.g. $ \frac{9\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ you are also multiplying by its reciprocal

$$
x  = \frac{9\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{9\pi}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{\pi} 
$$
multiply the numerators and denominators like normal
$9\pi \cdot 2 = 18\pi $ and  $ 1 \cdot \pi = \pi $

which results in $ \frac{18\pi}{\pi} $ cancel the pis and you have $ 18 $
