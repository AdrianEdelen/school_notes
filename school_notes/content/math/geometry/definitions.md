# Definitions

- **Angle**: Two line that meet to make a corner
- **Congruent**: Identical in size and shape.
- **Dimensions/Size**: Terminology to describe the dimensions of an object or set. With young children, the terms large, medium, small, taller, shorter, longer, less than and greater than are all appropriate.
- **Edge**: The meeting of two faces on a three-dimensional shape.
- **Face**: Surface planes of three-dimensional shapes.
- **Flat**: Having a plane-like quality.
- **Equilateral**: Sides that are the same length.
- **Parallel**: Two lines in a two-dimensional space that do not meet (for example, the opposite sides of a square). A parallelogram has two sets of parallel lines.
- **Plane**: A flat two-dimensional surface upon which two-dimensional objects (e.g., circle, square) can lie, or the face of a three-dimensional object as it creates a surface (e.g., face of a cube); the dimensions of which are infinite.
- **Point**: A specific position on a line, plane, or in space.
- **Side**: Line segments in geometric figures that compose the exterior of the object.
Straight: Without a curve.
- **Vertex/Vertices**: Also known as corner/corners. The point at which two sides of a two-dimensional figure or two edges of a three-dimensional figure meet.
