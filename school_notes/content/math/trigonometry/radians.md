# radians

Radian Angle Measures are defined as:
The measure of an angle in radians is the same as the arc length that the angle substands for r=1

We can convert an angle from degrees to radians with the following process:
- First recall that the circumference of a circle is $ C = 2 \pi r $
- In the unit circle $ r = 1 $ so the circumference of the unit circle is $ C = 2\pi 1 = 2\pi = 6.28 $ 
- Next we find the ratio of $ \frac{degrees}{circumference} $
- for an example of $ 200\deg $ we have $ \frac{200}{360} = \frac{5}{9}$
- Then we can cross multiply since $ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{x}{2\pi} $
  - Simplifies to: $ x = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 2\pi $
  - Simplifies to: $ x = \frac{10\pi}{9} $

### Finding the length of an arc with $ \theta $ in radians
This process is quite simple

$ Arc Length = r \cdot \theta $

### Finding the circumference with $ \theta $ in radians

if $ \theta $ and $ circumference $ is known

$ Arc Length = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot circumference $

so we can rearrange to solve for circumference

$ Circumference = \frac{Arc Length}{\frac{\theta}{2\pi}} = \frac{Arc Length \cdot 2\pi}{\theta} $

### Finding the radius with know $\theta$ and $Arc Length$

$ Arc Length = r \cdot \theta $

rearrange to 

$r = \frac{ArcLength}{\theta}$

Remember that theta will be a fraction (some number over pi) and so in order to solve for the radius ( dividing by theta) we need to multiply by the reciprocol 

### Finding Radian Measure of $\theta$ with known arc length and radius

$$\theta = \frac{s}{r} $$
A complete circle consists of an angle with measure $ 2\pi $ and so so an angle measure less than that, the
