# radians

## radians Defined
Radian Angle Measures are defined as:
The measure of an angle in radians is the same as the arc length that the angle substands for r=1

We can convert an angle from degrees to radians with the following process:
- First recall that the circumference of a circle is $ C = 2 \pi r $
- In the unit circle $ r = 1 $ so the circumference of the unit circle is $ C = 2\pi 1 = 2\pi = 6.28 $ 
- Next we find the ratio of $ \frac{degrees}{circumference} $
- for an example of $ 200\deg $ we have $ \frac{200}{360} = \frac{5}{9}$
- Then we can cross multiply since $ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{x}{2\pi} $
  - Simplifies to: $ x = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 2\pi $
  - Simplifies to: $ x = \frac{10\pi}{9} $

1° = (π)/180 radians. This gives us the formula to make conversions from degrees to radians and vice versa. Thus, to convert degrees to radians, use this formula = Degree measure × (π/180°). 1° = (π)/180 radians = 0.017453 radians.

$ \deg \cdot (\pi/180) = \text{degree measure in radians} $

### To convert radians back to degrees 
$ \deg = rad \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} $


### Finding the length of an arc with $ \theta $ in radians
This process is quite simple

$ Arc Length = r \cdot \theta $

### Finding the circumference with $ \theta $ in radians

if $ \theta $ and $ circumference $ is known

$ Arc Length = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot circumference $

so we can rearrange to solve for circumference

$ Circumference = \frac{Arc Length}{\frac{\theta}{2\pi}} = \frac{Arc Length \cdot 2\pi}{\theta} $

### Finding the radius with know $\theta$ and $Arc Length$

$$ Arc Length = r \cdot \theta $$

rearrange to 

$$r = \frac{ArcLength}{\theta}$$

Remember that theta will be a fraction (some number over pi) and so in order to solve for the radius ( dividing by theta) we need to multiply by the reciprocol 

### Finding Radian Measure of $\theta$ with known arc length and radius

$$\theta = \frac{s}{r} $$

### Finding the area of a sector 

A complete circle consists of an angle with measure $ 2\pi $ and so an angle measure less than that makes up a fraction of a complete circle $ \frac{\theta}{2\pi} $ the area for a complete circle with radius $r$ is $ A = \pi r^2 $

From here we can calculate the area of a sector to be:

$$
A = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}(\pi r^2) = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta
$$

### Finding $\theta$ with area and radius

redefine the formula to solve: 

$$\theta = \frac{2A}{r^2} $$
